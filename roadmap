Roadmap: since CP2 implementation is already done, next we'll work as a group to design and document the machine to include support for hazard detection and fowarding. Once the diagram is done, we'll assign specific people to the various tasks. We'll also want to spend some time debugging our current design more thoroughly than the checkpoint does, although the biggest issues are likely with the hazards, so that will come once those are implemented. We may also start looking at the advanced design options depending on how quickly cp3 stuff goes.
