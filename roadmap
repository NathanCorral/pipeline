Roadmap: since CP2 implementation is already done, next we'll work as a group to design and document the machine to include support for hazard detection and fowarding. Once the diagram is done, we'll assign specific people to the various tasks. We'll also want to spend some time debugging our current design more thoroughly than the checkpoint does, although the biggest issues are likely with the hazards, so that will come once those are implemented. We may also start looking at the advanced design options depending on how quickly cp3 stuff goes.

CP2 Roadmap: CP3 is almost all done. We need to work on the L2 cache, which I believe Nathan has done some work on already (but not finished yet). We'll need to do some significant stress testing to make sure there aren't bugs in the pipeline hazard detection unit, make sure that flushing occurs properly, etc. Once we've done some testing we'll start getting into some of the advanced design concepts. So far I think we've figured we'll probably at least do a multi cycle L2 cache, maybe 4 way set associative. We'll definitely implement some sort of branch prediction (not sure which type yet). We haven't discussed in depth other options yet but we'll be sure to do that soon.
